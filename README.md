Udacity Scholarship Chanllege  

#Problem: Identifying flower out of 102 species; image classification,

#Method: Pytorch is to solve this problem I have divided the model into two sections one is a pre-train model and the second one to classify the flower species.
#pre-train: Pytorch provides us with different pre-train models I selected dense201 network 
#output:finally accuracy is 96% 
#How to run: Use collab link
